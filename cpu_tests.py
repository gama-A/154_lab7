cpu_tests.py File to test implementation of single-cycle MIPS CPU as

Usage:  Place this file in the same directory as your cpu.py
        You can then run `pytest cpu_tests.py` to run all tests in this file
        Alternatively you can run specific tests by `pytest cpu_tests.py::test_name` such as

Note: If you fail a test, you can render the trace by adding `sim_trace.render_trace()` in the failing test
